In my dreams I can barely feel textures properly and when I try to read text it is usually blurry or changes constantly. I have been doing reality checks regularly and I can become lucid consistently but once I am lucid I struggle to make the dream more vivid and realistic. What techniques do you use to improve the clarity and detail of your lucid dreams? I have tried spinning and rubbing my hands together but these techniques only work occasionally and the effect does not last very long. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!'
